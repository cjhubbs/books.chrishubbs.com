      <content type="html">I finished reading Still Just a Geek by Wil Wheaton.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;Wil Wheaton is one of those guys I just admire. He&amp;rsquo;s been so open about his challenges with his parents, his mental health, his career&amp;hellip; and equally so open about his love for his family and his care for others who struggle. His updated, annotated memoir is a combination of his old blog posts, narrative pulling it together, and copious, almost &lt;em&gt;Infinite Jest&lt;/em&gt;-ian footnotes. It&amp;rsquo;s a delight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making me equally happy is Wil&amp;rsquo;s assurance that Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Levar Burton, Michael Dorn, Brent Spiner, and so many more from the ST:TNG cast are, in reality, as good if not better people than the roles they played on TV.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading Every Good Boy Does Fine by Jeremy Denk.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;I love reading books by pianists. Mostly they remind me that while I&amp;rsquo;m a decent classical pianist, there&amp;rsquo;s a long step between me and a real, serious concert pianist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denk feels in some ways a little young to be writing a memoir like this. It&amp;rsquo;s really about his learning the piano and a little bit about him learning about life and about himself. It&amp;rsquo;s heavier on the piano teaching and technique than on the personal stuff, though the insights from his various teachers were interesting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want to spend some time with the annotated appendix of referenced piano works to get familiar with some that are new to me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading The Last Agent by Robert Dugoni.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;An entertaining spy novel, a genre which I hadn&amp;rsquo;t read in a while. Should&amp;rsquo;ve started with the first one but this one stood alone well enough. I&amp;rsquo;ll go back to the first one now, though, and fill in the gap.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Simply lovely and delightful. Itâ€™s somehow as if Wendell Berry started writing sci-fi short stories. I will be coming back to this one for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
