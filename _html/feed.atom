      <content type="html">I finished reading Agent Josephine by Damien Lewis.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;This book tried to be too long with too little source material. The author (a British journalist) was working from 3 short books written by primary characters in the story, and with so little material he leaves us with nothing about Baker&amp;rsquo;s life before or after the war, and gives us large swaths of WWII history that have little to do with Baker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get the sense from the book that Josephine Baker was a remarkable woman, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to read a better biography of her.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading On The Soul and the Resurrection by Saint Gregory (of Nyssa).

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;A lucid, short treatise from a 4th-century father. Very readable translation, too!&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading Dead Lions by Mick Herron.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;Second book in the series, similar to the first. A little bit oblique, written with a little more style than your usual pop spy novel.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading The Evolution of Knowledge by JÃ¼rgen Renn.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;A thick book, Dr. Renn spends most of the time overviewing how human knowledge has accumulated over time. He spends frustratingly little time theorizing how those insights might lead us to think about the future. The &amp;ldquo;future&amp;rdquo; part is only about 15 pages at the end. I&amp;rsquo;m glad I read it just to stretch my brain, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t come away from it with any deep thoughts about the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading Out of the Embers by Bradley Jersak.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;Jersak describes the experience of spiritual deconstruction and the path through it to something better in gracious, loving terms. Rich in grace and wisdom, filled with the assurance of God&amp;rsquo;s love, Jersak encourages those going through deconstruction to consider the words of (among others) Doystoevski and Simone Weil. The strongest bits of the book, though, are the first and third sections where he speaks pastorally to the challenged. Wonderful stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading Still Just a Geek by Wil Wheaton.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;Wil Wheaton is one of those guys I just admire. He&amp;rsquo;s been so open about his challenges with his parents, his mental health, his career&amp;hellip; and equally so open about his love for his family and his care for others who struggle. His updated, annotated memoir is a combination of his old blog posts, narrative pulling it together, and copious, almost &lt;em&gt;Infinite Jest&lt;/em&gt;-ian footnotes. It&amp;rsquo;s a delight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making me equally happy is Wil&amp;rsquo;s assurance that Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Levar Burton, Michael Dorn, Brent Spiner, and so many more from the ST:TNG cast are, in reality, as good if not better people than the roles they played on TV.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading Every Good Boy Does Fine by Jeremy Denk.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;I love reading books by pianists. Mostly they remind me that while I&amp;rsquo;m a decent classical pianist, there&amp;rsquo;s a long step between me and a real, serious concert pianist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denk feels in some ways a little young to be writing a memoir like this. It&amp;rsquo;s really about his learning the piano and a little bit about him learning about life and about himself. It&amp;rsquo;s heavier on the piano teaching and technique than on the personal stuff, though the insights from his various teachers were interesting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want to spend some time with the annotated appendix of referenced piano works to get familiar with some that are new to me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading The Last Agent by Robert Dugoni.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;An entertaining spy novel, a genre which I hadn&amp;rsquo;t read in a while. Should&amp;rsquo;ve started with the first one but this one stood alone well enough. I&amp;rsquo;ll go back to the first one now, though, and fill in the gap.&lt;/p&gt;
