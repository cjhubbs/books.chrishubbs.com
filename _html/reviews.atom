      <content type="html">I finished reading God on the Rocks by Phil Madeira.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;A sort of collection of short memoir-based essays&amp;hellip; Madeira recounts life growing up as a Baptist pastor&amp;rsquo;s kid, the pain of what we would today call religous deconstruction, and the joy of life. Nothing revolutionary, but not a bad read.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading Hunting Time by Jeffery Deaver.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;Feels like a middle-weight Deaver book. I get that mysteries are supposed to have a twist at the end, but this one seems far too big and unbelievable given the beginning of the book. In addition, the early part of the story seems pretty bland, isn&amp;rsquo;t very twisty. Not bad, but not amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;Maybe more like 4.5 stars than 4. I didn&amp;rsquo;t just &lt;em&gt;adore&lt;/em&gt; the book, but I appreciated the characters and the conflict. A memorable, warm story in its own way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading Record of a Spaceborn Few by Becky Chambers.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;Becky Chambers invents a universe I would want to live in, and populates it with sympathetic, kind characters. In a genre that frequently gets dark and dystopian, she writes hopeful fiction. I need more of that.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading The Technology Trap by Carl Benedikt Frey.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;An interesting overview of the impact of revolutionary technology on society at large. In general, the recurring theme, says the author, is that people whose jobs are eliminated are worse off in the short run, but in the longer run everyone is better off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting to read his thoughts on the upcoming &amp;ldquo;AI revolution&amp;rdquo; as he wrote in the 2019 timeframe, prior to COVID, ChatCPT, and the like. Some of his predictions about the immediate ascent of AI have already flopped; others are certainly not moving as fast as he anticipated. Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Really should be 4.5 stars. Even more enjoyable than the first book in the series.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading A Hidden Wholeness by Parker J. Palmer.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;Palmer sharing his wisdom and practical principles for operating a &amp;lsquo;circle of trust&amp;rsquo; - a principle where a small group of people care for each other primarily through quiet, acceptance, non-judgment, and loving, non-leading questions. An idea that speaks profoundly to me. Palmer makes me want to find and attend a Quaker meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading Not All Who Wander (Spiritually) Are Lost by Traci Rhoades.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;Flimsy, not particularly well written, and&amp;hellip; naive, maybe? Basically 150 pages of &amp;ldquo;yes, people go to different kinds of churches and sometimes move between them&amp;rdquo;. Not sure that qualifies as &amp;ldquo;wandering&amp;rdquo;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure who this book was aimed for but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for me.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;A world-class artist and thoughtful believer articulating the deep connection between artistry and faith. Beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading Joel on Software by Avram Joel Spolsky.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I was reading Joel Spolsky&amp;rsquo;s blog at the time these pieces were originally published, but it was close. The programming and computer technology he&amp;rsquo;s talking about here is of course 20 years old and thus very dated, but his commentary on management and people dynamics is still spot-on and his writing is still entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading Mindsight by Daniel J. Siegel.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;Siegel is basically advocating a practice of mindfulness and emotional integration. The first half of the book is very solid, though it would&amp;rsquo;ve benefitted from getting rid of the foofy name. &amp;ldquo;Mindsight&amp;rdquo; makes it sound like a ridiculous pop self-help book. The second half of the book, primarily made up of case stories, is less interesting and beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;A little bit of work reading. A great summary of common software architecture patterns, their strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading The Three-Body Problem by Liu Cixin.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;On re-read: still one of the most inventive sci-fi books I&amp;rsquo;ve read. Liu explores what interaction with an alien race of immense technology might be like, working at the quantum level as well as the interstellar. The first half of the book struggles to get going, but once the reveal happens and the book includes the alien civilization, the story comes alive.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading The Peaceable Kingdom by Stanley Hauerwas.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just a bit dated, but Hauerwas seems most focused here on non-violence among all the Christian ethic, and his heavy reliance on Yoder feels painful given what we now know about Yoder&amp;rsquo;s personal conduct.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;One of the most helpful theological books I&amp;rsquo;ve read in a long time. Green looks first at the Christian vocation for the sake of others, then at how Christians are called to holiness, and only then finally to how the Scripture may be interpreted in a way that works holiness within us for the sake of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really rich stuff, so much to chew on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading The Passenger by Cormac McCarthy.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;On one hand, it feels like if I&amp;rsquo;m not rating a McCarthy book highly, it&amp;rsquo;s a shortcoming on my part, not his. And yet it doens&amp;rsquo;t feel like top-tier McCarthy. Still distinctly his voice, but not quite in the tier of his classics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading Heretic by Jeanna Kadlec.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;If there was ever a time for a 3.5 star rating, this is it. The writing is uneven in spots - the first chapter, and near the end. It gets tight and compelling when she starts describing her first queer relationship, and at the end when she talks about finding community and interacting with Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways I&amp;rsquo;m very close to this story. Heck, my city and my employer are name-checked (rather unnecessarily) in the book. And in other ways I&amp;rsquo;m not so close. (My departure from the evangelical church wasn&amp;rsquo;t paired with any self-discovery about my sexuality.) What I resonate with here was the heartbreak of leaving the church, and what I jealously desire is the sense of community she has found in other places. (Will I ever find it?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the certain sort of reader who needs to know that leaving church is OK, this book is a godsend. For others it may be less than compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
