      <content type="html">I finished reading Quantum Reality by Nick Herbert.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;A little bit dated at this point, but a very digestible introduction to quantum theory.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;I get what LeGuin was going for, but this one just didn&amp;rsquo;t land for me. Plenty of idea, not enough story.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading On the Origin of Time by Thomas Hertog.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;Hertog studied quantum physics under Stephen Hawking and here overviews Hawking&amp;rsquo;s progression of thought in quantum physics, ending in a remarkable position regaining the importance of the human perspective within these theories. You don&amp;rsquo;t expect to get to the last chapter of a book like this and have it start quoting Hannah Arendt, and yet this one did. Thoughtful, not overly simplified but simplified enough for nerdy laymen like me to be able to wade through it&amp;hellip; quite a book.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading Red Queen by Juan GÃ³mez-Jurado.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;Entertaining detective novel. Nothing deep, but a nice palate cleanser.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading The Odyssey by Homer.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;Emily Wilson&amp;rsquo;s translation of The Odyssey pulled me in in a way that other translations have failed to grab me. Obviously an epic story, but her translation choices made it come alive in reading.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading Average Jones by Samuel Adams.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;Short detective stories in the vein of Sherlock Holmes, but set in early 20th-century America. They&amp;rsquo;re fine, but mostly serve to remind you just &lt;em&gt;how good&lt;/em&gt; Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&amp;rsquo;s stories were by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;A brilliant examination of gender and personhood wrapped up in an adventure story. Really enjoyed this one.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading The Ultimate Quest by Jordan Haynie Ware.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;A short handbook intro to the Episcopal Church. The subtitle &amp;ldquo;A Geek&amp;rsquo;s Guide to The Episcopal Church&amp;rdquo; tells you where it&amp;rsquo;s going, and it goes HARD. Some of the geek references were helpful; some of them seemed pretty over-the-top, but you can&amp;rsquo;t deny the author&amp;rsquo;s commitment to the bit. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s a book I might hand to my college aged kid if they had any interested in attending.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading The Book of Job - a Biography by Mark Larrimore.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been a fan of other books in this Lives of Great Religious Books series, but this one didn&amp;rsquo;t really do it for me. Less about how Job came about and more about how it has been interpreted through time. Which isn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip; just wasn&amp;rsquo;t what I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading Until the End of Time by Brian Greene.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;The bits where Greene is explaining physics are wonderful. The bits where he tries to theorize about how the effects of physics manifest in things like meaning and belief are pretty weak.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;A brisk, moving memoir of a leader in the American movement for disabled rights. I had no idea that the Americans with Disabilities Act wasn&amp;rsquo;t passed until I was in high school.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading Birth of a Dancing Star by Ilia Delio.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;As a review on Goodreads said, it&amp;rsquo;s a little more a recount than a memoir with an overarching theme and narrative. But it&amp;rsquo;s a great companion piece to Delio&amp;rsquo;s theological books; it provides a vivid perspective of the woman behind the ideas and words.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Rohr unpacks the Twelve Steps in the framework of the Gospel. Beautiful, simple, and helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading Christ in Evolution by Ilia Delio.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;Delio says that Christianity&amp;rsquo;s cosmology needs to keep up with science, and explores through the writing of Teilhard de Chardin, Thomas Merton, Raimon Panikkar, and others just what that might look like. Mind bending in all the best ways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading Secular Faith by Mark A. Smith.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;Smith argues from history that American religious beliefs largely eventually adopt broader secular trends. He uses topics like feminism and abortion as examples. The book was published in 2015 - would be very interesting to get his take now after the strong religious backlash and rise of Christian nationalist fascism since 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading Trauma-Informed Evangelism by Charles Kiser.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;A good overview of spiritual and religious trauma and how Christians wanting to minister to the traumatized should approach the idea. The last couple chapters of practical application were particularly helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">I finished reading Babel by R. F. Kuang.

        

        

        &lt;p&gt;A fantasy novel that serves as a strong critique of colonialism, a meditation on technology, and remains a moving story of adventure and friendship. The best novel I&amp;rsquo;ve read in quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;A well-researched an engaging tale of the Academy Awards throughout their almost 100-year history. Politics, personalities, cultural influences&amp;hellip; interesting to read about. Schulman makes this book an easy read while painting a vibrant picture of a messy industry.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;For an incredibly niche subject, this is a wonderfully interesting and accessible book. A history of the original archaelogial digs at Megiddo that happened in the 1920s and 30s. Chapters alternate between describing the people and their challenges and then the actual archaeological work. Good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
