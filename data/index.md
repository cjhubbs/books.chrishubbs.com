Still trying to keep track of 

* the [books Iâ€™ve read](/reviews/), 
* which books [I want to read](/to-read/), 
* useless [statistics](/stats/)

If you're really interested in what I'm reading, you can [subscribe to the feed](/feed.atom) (feed with only reviews [here](/reviews.atom)).

Thanks for the inspiration (and a lot of the code!) for this site go to [Rixx](https://books.rixx.de).
