I've enjoyed a lot of Sawyer's stuff, but this one left me cold. More a novella than a full-length novel, The Downloaded is entirely narrated in first-person interviews. There are a couple interesting technical ideas but they aren't explored in enough detail to really be compelling. All in all, a disappointing book.
