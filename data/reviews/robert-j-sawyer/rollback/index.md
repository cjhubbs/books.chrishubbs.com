I became a fan of Sawyer’s a few years ago, but this one cements him as one of my current favorites in the sci-fi genre. In Rollback, a husband and his famous scientist wife are offered the chance for gene therapy to “roll back” their aging process – to take them from age 85 to age 25. His rollback works – hers doesn’t. Sawyer does a good job of exploring the dilemmas and frustrations a man in that position would face. Fun reading.
