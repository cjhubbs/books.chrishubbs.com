Having watched the short-lived ABC television series "based on" this book, I was curious to see how Sawyer (an author I really like) actually envisioned the topic.  Thankfully, all of the soap opera and cop drama aspects of the TV series disappeared and instead what we got was a short story exploring (just a bit) the science aspects, and mostly asking this question: how would people respond if they got a brief glimpse of their future?<br/><br/>Flashforward is a easy entertaining read.  Not as good as some of Sawyer's other stuff (the Hominids trilogy is my particular favorite), but still worth a read.
