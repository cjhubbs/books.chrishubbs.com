A fantastic challenging read that will transform the way I think about Grace. Capon mixes storytelling with theologising quite effectively, driving his points home with insight and humor.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I'm on board with his conclusions on eschatology in the last bit of the book, but the first two-thirds are quite enough to warrant five stars for this fantastic volume.
