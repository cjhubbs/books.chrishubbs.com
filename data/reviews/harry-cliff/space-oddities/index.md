Cliff is a particle physicist writing about the fun, unexplained quirks of particle physics. Probably a little dense for the casual reader, but hit the sweet spot for me. It becomes clear that he mostly wants to write about his own project - at least, the chapter on his project is about 3x as long as all the others. Still, he communicates really well and his enthusiasm for the subject is on every page.
