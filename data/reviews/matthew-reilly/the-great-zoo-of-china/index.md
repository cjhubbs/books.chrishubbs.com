Can't give the book 5 stars - reserved for truly great books - but neither can I penalize Reilly. He knows what he doing in this genre and brings us another semi-plausible page-turner. <br/><br/>As usual, it feels like a fast bloody action movie transcribed down into a book, which gets tiring as a steady diet, but is fun from time to time. <br/><br/>Easy, quick, fluffy reading.
