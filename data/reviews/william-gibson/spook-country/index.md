Gibson is one of those authors I know I’m supposed to like, but I struggle with really getting into his books. This one was OK – I was tempted to put it down half-way through, but I hate quitting books in the middle. Still, it took me a week to read it because I didn’t have any trouble putting it down to do other things.
