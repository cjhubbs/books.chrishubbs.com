My official blog review of this one won’t come for a few weeks yet, but this is a funny little memoir from a guy who grew up in an independent fundamental Baptist church. While I didn’t grow up in a church like that, I grew up close enough to that culture to have the book resonate with me. A quick, enjoyable read.
