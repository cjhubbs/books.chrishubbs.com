Pastor Richard bought this one for all of the elders and we’re gonna go through it together. I found it reasonable, but not exactly revolutionary. Frazee’s conclusion: live a community-based, integrated life, and restrict your work to half the day (he suggests 6 AM – 6 PM), saving the remaining hours for family time and sleep. A bit pie-in-the-sky, the more I think about it.
