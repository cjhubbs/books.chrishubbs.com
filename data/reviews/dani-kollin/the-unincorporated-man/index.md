Ah, a sci-fi novel in the footsteps of Heinlein.  Sweeping scope, major cultural themes, overly preachy but still a compelling read.  Excellent stuff.  <br/><br/>The title character, Justin, is a man from the 20th century who, after being cryonically frozen, is brought back to life in the 23rd century, in a culture where each person is incorporated at birth, and can buy and sell their shares on the open market.  Justin struggles to understand and adapt to this culture, given his status as The Unincorporated Man.<br/><br/>Good, good stuff.
