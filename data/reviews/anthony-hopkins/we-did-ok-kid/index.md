I've always enjoyed Anthony Hopkins as an actor since seeing him in The Remains of the Day when I was in high school. His memoir here is brisk and easy to read, but you get the sense that he has slowly done the work to come to peace with and acceptance of himself. May we all be willing to do that work.
