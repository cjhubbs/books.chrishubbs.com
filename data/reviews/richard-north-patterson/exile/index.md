I’ve been a fan of RNP’s novels for a while – generally lengthy (which I like) and detailed/twisted enough to be enjoyable. This story, though, was less a twisted novel and more an excursus into the politics of the Middle East wrapped in a slim fictional wrapper. Still an interesting read, though – he did a lot of research, and the characters and situations, while fictional in detail, are undoubtedly representative of real people.
