Suarez is the modern heir to Michael Crichton, doing for computers what Crichton did for biology and genetics. While this book was based around a fascinating concept, there was no real surprise as to where it was going from nearly the first chapter. Compared to Suarez' earlier books, this one was fine but not nearly as engaging or tense.
