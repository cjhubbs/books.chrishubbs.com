A very thought-provoking book and a great way to end my 2023 reading. Hoffman proposes that humans have evolved not to perceive the "objective" universe, but rather a view of the universe that is useful for "fitness". So what, begs the question, is 'objective' reality? Hoffman doesn't have an answer for that question, but suggests that reality may be more defined by the interaction between conscious beings than by some objective _stuff_. This goes down the same lines I've heard Ilia Delio suggest, that quantum reality is about the relationships between observers. Fascinating stuff.
