Tangentially in the DaVinci Code genre, this one focuses on a long-lost ancient manuscript, but at least this time religion isnâ€™t involved. Scholars and mobsters cross continents and unravel codes in search of the lost play of William Shakespeare. I dug it for a while, but by the end it was losing me. Just OK, really, not great.
