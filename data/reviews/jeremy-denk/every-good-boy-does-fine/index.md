I love reading books by pianists. Mostly they remind me that while I'm a decent classical pianist, there's a long step between me and a real, serious concert pianist. 

Denk feels in some ways a little young to be writing a memoir like this. It's really about his learning the piano and a little bit about him learning about life and about himself. It's heavier on the piano teaching and technique than on the personal stuff, though the insights from his various teachers were interesting. 

I _do_ want to spend some time with the annotated appendix of referenced piano works to get familiar with some that are new to me.
