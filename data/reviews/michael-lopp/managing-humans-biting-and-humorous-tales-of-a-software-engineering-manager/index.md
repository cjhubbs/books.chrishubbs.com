This book was recommended highly by Geof, and the author (who goes by his nom de cyber, Rands) is brilliant at Rands in Repose, so I finally bought it from Amazon and gave it a whirl. While Randsâ€™ high-tech world of internet startups and quick-turn user applications is a long mile from my process-driven avionics development world, he still has good insights on management and nerds. A good read.
