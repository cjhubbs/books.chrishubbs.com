I guess when your previous book was a huge history of Christianity you have a lot of notes left over. Epic in scope, mostly Western-focused, this is an interesting survey of Christian attitudes toward and practices around sex and marriage. MacCulloch still definitely has opinions but doesn't feel like he's putting his thumb on the scale _too_ much.
