As someone who grew up in 1990’s evangelical purity culture, this book is such a breath of fresh air. It’s a call to reconsider so many unhealthy messages and dynamics purity culture created, and to live a life of wisdom and discernment in community. <br/><br/>While the author remains more conservative than I do on several of these topics, I would happily put this book over and over in the hands of its target audience: members of the evangelical culture I grew up in.
