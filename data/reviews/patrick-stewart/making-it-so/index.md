Sir Patrick's memoir is just as delightful as you would hope. From stories about his humble beginnings in Yorkshire to tales about making ST:TNG, Stewart's tone is engaging. I don't typically do audiobooks but I would go listen to this one simply to hear the book in his own voice. A truly lovely book.
