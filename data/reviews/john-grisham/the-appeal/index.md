With his return to the legal genre and the two-word title, I had hopes that Grishamâ€™s story would be a return to his stories of old, stories where the heroes battle difficult struggles but still prevail. No such luck. Grisham has continued to decide to be preachy rather than tell a good story. Disappointing.
