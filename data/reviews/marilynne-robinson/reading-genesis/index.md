I wasn't sure what to expect from Robinson writing on Genesis, but I enjoy her writing enough it was definitely something I was going to read. Structured as a narrative commentary, Robinson doesn't employ chapter breaks or other touchpoints within the text itself. It's fascinating to read a commentary by a Christian writer who takes the text seriously but not necessarily literally. If there is a broad "point" to her book, it is to feature the uniqueness of Genesis among the Ancient Near Eastern texts, and to highlight the theme of unmerited grace that runs through it. From God's forgiveness of Cain to Joseph's forgiveness of his brothers, Robinson tells us that Genesis is set apart from the other ANE texts this way.

I appreciated her book, but didn't enjoy it as much as reading her essays. I need to pick them up for a re-read.
