I'm still chewing on whether or not to give this book five stars.  This book is a fairly logical progression from <i>Simply Christian</i> and <i>Surprised by Hope</i>.  Once Wright has discussed what it means to be Christian and then has outlined the Christian's hope for eternity, this volume deals with the idea of the Christian ethic or virtue.  <br/><br/>Wright works with many passages both from the Gospels and from Paul's epistles to explain the concept of Christian virtue - the idea that by practicing virtuous character in the here and now, we are anticipating preparing ourselves for the way things will be in the eternal kingdom.<br/><br/>Once again good stuff from Wright.  If I were to rank the books in this trilogy, I'd have to go with <i>Surprised by Hope</i> as number one, but <i>After You Believe</i> would be a solid #2.
