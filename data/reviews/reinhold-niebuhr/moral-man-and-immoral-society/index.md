The first half of the book: solid 5-stars. Niebuhr's analysis of cultural and group dynamics is as applicable to 2025 as it was to 1931. The second half of the book: unfulfilling. Two chapters dallying with socialism and Marxism. Final couple chapters with some vague gestures of what approaches might bring hope. Interesting as political philosophy but ultimately didn't really do it for me.
