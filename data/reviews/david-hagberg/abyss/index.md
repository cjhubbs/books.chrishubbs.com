I should've known just from the cover and flyleaf that this particular bit if genre fiction was going to be a train wreck. And yet, like a train wreck, once I started I couldn't look away. <br/><br/>Ridiculous plot premise, unbelievable protagonist (former CIA director turned bodyguard?!?), uninspired prose and underdeveloped characters fill the 400+ pages of this tome. The author seems contractually obligated to describe each female character in terms of breast size, but mishandles the interpersonal scenes so badly that you wonder if he's actually ever had an interpersonal relationship. <br/><br/>The cover of the book proclaims it to be "A Kirk McGarvey Novel", leading me to believe that there are more books out there starring this ridiculous character. My advice: avoid them. Avoid this one, too.
