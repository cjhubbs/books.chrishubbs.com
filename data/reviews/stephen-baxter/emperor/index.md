I’ve been a big fan of Baxter’s sci-fi writing in the past (the Manifold: series is worth a re-read here sometime soon) so I picked this one up on the strength of his name alone. Supposedly this is an “alternate history” novel. I’ll have to admit that I guess I’m not familiar enough with the early Roman domination of Britain to know which parts were alternate. It does have an ending that really sets up the next book, though… not a bad read.
