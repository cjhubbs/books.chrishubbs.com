I should’ve known better than to pick this one up. Fresh off his last novel which was part of the whole set of DaVinci Code knock-offs, this one set out to deny the other testament of the Bible. In this one, Sts. Jerome and Augustine conspired to mistranslate the Old Testament to give the Jews claim to Palestine rather than the real place they were from: Arabia. Give me a break. I won’t be picking up another Steve Berry book.
