I was glad to finally read the book version of a movie that I enjoyed. Ishiguro captures the focused dedication of an English butler in entertaining fashion. I am impressed by how closely the movie stayed to the novel; and the role of Stevens will always be played, in my head, by Sir Anthony Hopkins.
