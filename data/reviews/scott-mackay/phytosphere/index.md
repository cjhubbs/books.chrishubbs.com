A short sci-fi novel that reads like a script to a cheesy SciFi channel made-for-TV movie. The basics: aliens want to emigrate to Earth, but can’t come to an agreement with the UN on where they will be allowed to live. So, they generate a “phytosphere” (i.e. a green, growing shroud) around the earth to kill off everything. Much more time spent on the drama of crisis on earth than in the actual sci-fi stuff. Kinda lame, but still moderately entertaining.
