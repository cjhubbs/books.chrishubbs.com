Oh man. A coming of age story full of spiritual awakening, but an awakening that is more like deconstruction. Kirk captures the authentic inner and outer voices of youth growing up in conservative Evangelical circles, grappling with love, loss, and church teachings that just don't make sense.

It may not be for everyone, but it hits me right between the eyes, and makes me wish my awakening and deconstruction had come at 18 and not 38.
