Meticulously researched and compellingly told. Kaplan strings together the development of bebop and the evolution of free jazz and fusion through the stories of Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Bill Evans. I'm struck mostly by the tragedy of it all. Troubled men, forever addicted to and strung out on drugs and alcohol, somehow in the midst of it creating brilliant, amazing music.
