I love _The West Wing_ and wanted to love the book. It's sort of an oral history of the show mashed up with the cast members' stories of civic service. And while that's a noble and commendable cause, the writing is just too informal, and the book goes on way too long.There's no reason this needs to be 640 pages. It feels like a fan magazine that went about 6 issues too long.
