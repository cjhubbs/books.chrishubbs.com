A short handbook intro to the Episcopal Church. The subtitle "A Geek's Guide to The Episcopal Church" tells you where it's going, and it goes HARD. Some of the geek references were helpful; some of them seemed pretty over-the-top, but you can't deny the author's commitment to the bit. Still, it's a book I might hand to my college aged kid if they had any interested in attending.
