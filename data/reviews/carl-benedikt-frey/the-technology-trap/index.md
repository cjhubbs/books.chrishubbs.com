An interesting overview of the impact of revolutionary technology on society at large. In general, the recurring theme, says the author, is that people whose jobs are eliminated are worse off in the short run, but in the longer run everyone is better off. 

Interesting to read his thoughts on the upcoming "AI revolution" as he wrote in the 2019 timeframe, prior to COVID, ChatCPT, and the like. Some of his predictions about the immediate ascent of AI have already flopped; others are certainly not moving as fast as he anticipated. Time will tell.
