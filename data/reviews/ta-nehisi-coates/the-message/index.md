Another stunning book from Coates. First, he's just a beautiful writer, crafting prose with carefully chosen words that add layers of color, texture, and meaning. Second, he's written an insightful and challenging book, letting us follow along as he questions his own understanding of the narratives he's been taught (and promulgated). From the streets of Dakar to the hills of Palestine, Coates works to open our eyes as he recognizes his eyes are opening. A superb book.
