OK, so I didnâ€™t really plan to read two McCarthy novels in a row, but I ditched the Salman Rushdie book about a hundred pages in. So instead I catch up on McCarthy. Superlatives fail me. Not a complex plot, but beautifully written and picturesque in a way you rarely find. I can understand why they rate McCarthy as one of the top American authors. Good stuff.
