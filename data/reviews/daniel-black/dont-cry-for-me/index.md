A novel written as a series of letters from a black father to his son. There's a huge amount of trauma being worked out in this book, both by the characters in the story and by the author who is writing this, per the Author Note in the front, as his own imaginative work of healing in his relationship with his father who is dying of Alzheimers. 

There's a lot to think about with this one: generational and racial trauma, fathers and sons, hardened masculinity... even as a straight white man it'll have me thinking about my own father and how his and his father's upbringing impacted his parenting. Phew.
