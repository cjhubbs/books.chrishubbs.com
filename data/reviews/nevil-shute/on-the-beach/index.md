Ah, 1960s nuclear apocalypse, a genre nearly unto itself. Shute provides the reader a better than average rendition, choosing to focus on he reactions of individuals as they each try to come to grips with the fact that death, in the form of nuclear fallout, is heading their way. Sobering not so much from the anti-nuclear perspective, but moreso from asking 'how would I react?'.<br/><br/>Worth the read.
