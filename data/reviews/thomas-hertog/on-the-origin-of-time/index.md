Hertog studied quantum physics under Stephen Hawking and here overviews Hawking's progression of thought in quantum physics, ending in a remarkable position regaining the importance of the human perspective within these theories. You don't expect to get to the last chapter of a book like this and have it start quoting Hannah Arendt, and yet this one did. Thoughtful, not overly simplified but simplified enough for nerdy laymen like me to be able to wade through it... quite a book.
