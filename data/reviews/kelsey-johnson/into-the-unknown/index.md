A thoughtful, reasonable exploration of some of the challenging scientific questions in the universe. Written maybe just a baby step above the popular level, Dr. Johnson still makes these big questions very understandable and is willing to draw the lines around what we do know, what we can know, and what is impossible to know. A delightful and entertaining read.
