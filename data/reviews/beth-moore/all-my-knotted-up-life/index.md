I mean, the memoir of a 60-something Baptist woman isn't one of those books that a mid-40s exvangelical would be naturally drawn to, right? Beth Moore writes in her own unique voice, and it's definitely memoir more than biography - spending lots of time in certain eras of her childhood, and barely skimming much of her adult life.

That all being said, to add the knowledge of her personal story to her public persona is a great blessing. 

Back before Twitter imploded, Auntie Beth was my favorite follow. Her clear love for Jesus and the Bible combined with her willingness to speak the truth even when it ran counter to her denomination and culture were such a dear example to all of us listening in. Getting this glimpse of her backstory only causes me to love her more.
