Wil Wheaton is one of those guys I just admire. He's been so open about his challenges with his parents, his mental health, his career... and equally so open about his love for his family and his care for others who struggle. His updated, annotated memoir is a combination of his old blog posts, narrative pulling it together, and copious, almost _Infinite Jest_-ian footnotes. It's a delight.

Making me equally happy is Wil's assurance that Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Levar Burton, Michael Dorn, Brent Spiner, and so many more from the ST:TNG cast are, in reality, as good if not better people than the roles they played on TV.
