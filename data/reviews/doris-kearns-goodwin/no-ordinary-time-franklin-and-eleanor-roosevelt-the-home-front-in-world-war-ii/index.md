A history of the American experience in 1940-1944, through the lens of the Roosevelt White House. DKG knows how to tell a story by pulling in the lives of the people surrounding the “name” players. (Another good example of this is her more recent book on Lincoln.) Interesting stuff. I don’t read enough history.
