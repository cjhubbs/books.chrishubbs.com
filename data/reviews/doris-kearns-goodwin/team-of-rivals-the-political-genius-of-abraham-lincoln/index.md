Iâ€™ve been working on this one for a while. Goodwin does a heck of a job at weaving an engaging narrative. She shows how Lincoln brilliantly pulled his political rivals onto his team, and then managed to keep them together and effective throughout the Civil War. I knew before that I was impressed with Lincoln; after this book I am even more so. Good, good book.
