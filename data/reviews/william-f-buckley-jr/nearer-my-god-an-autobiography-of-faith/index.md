I think this one may have been a re-read for me â€“ parts of it seemed vaguely familiar. Still, worth the read. The emphasis in this volume is far more on the faith than the autobiography; most of the chapters address how he, as a thinker and intellectual, addresses and comes to grips with his (Roman Catholic) beliefs. Well written, insightful, good stuff.
