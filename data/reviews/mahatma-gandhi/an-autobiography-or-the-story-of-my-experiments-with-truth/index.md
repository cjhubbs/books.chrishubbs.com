If one of the Desert Fathers was a lawyer by training and had a Substack newsletter, he would write this kind of autobiography. Gandhi: super weird, writing in short episodes. Published in 1927 but effectively only covers his life up to 1921 when he took leadership of the Indian National Congress. Reasonably informative; unreasonably boring.
