A short volume that provides some interesting insights into early 1800's American culture.  However, it often gets repetitive, and you have to be willing to put up with the constant personal notes, requests for replies, etc. (These are <i>letters</i>, after all...)<br/><br/>Interesting as a snapshot of a certain place and time, but increasingly tedious toward the end.
