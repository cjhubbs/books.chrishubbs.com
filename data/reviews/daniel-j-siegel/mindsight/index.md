Siegel is basically advocating a practice of mindfulness and emotional integration. The first half of the book is very solid, though it would've benefitted from getting rid of the foofy name. "Mindsight" makes it sound like a ridiculous pop self-help book. The second half of the book, primarily made up of case stories, is less interesting and beneficial.
