A very readable, accessible summary of the deconstructed evangelicalism in the stream of Greg Boyd, Brian Zahnd, and Brad Jersak. This is the one to give a friend who is struggling with the inherent inconsistencies of popular evangelical teaching to provide a good introduction before diving into the deep end.
