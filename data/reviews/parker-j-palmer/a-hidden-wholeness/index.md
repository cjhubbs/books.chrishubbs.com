Palmer sharing his wisdom and practical principles for operating a 'circle of trust' - a principle where a small group of people care for each other primarily through quiet, acceptance, non-judgment, and loving, non-leading questions. An idea that speaks profoundly to me. Palmer makes me want to find and attend a Quaker meeting.
