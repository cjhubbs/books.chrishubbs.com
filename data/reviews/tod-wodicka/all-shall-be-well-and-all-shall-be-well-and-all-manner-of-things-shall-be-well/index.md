Not sure what prompted me to pick this one up. It’s an odd little story about a guy who is a medieval times reenactor, except that he’s so uncomfortable with modern life that he prefers to stay in character all the time. Of course, this wreaks havoc with his family. Overall a messed-up, depressing story. Very odd.
