Henderson is a retired Iowa history teacher who grew up in and then left Evangelical Christianity. As he acknowledges in the preface, this book is more or less a collection of blog posts on various "why evangelicals are wrong" or "what evangelicals need to learn" topics. It's well-meaning, not particularly deep, and badly in need of an editor and a proof-reader. (Homonyms sneak past spell check every time!)

I did find his chapter on "what Evangelical men could learn from gay men" and "why Christians should be Humanists" to be unusual additions to the usual topics, and worth some thought. On the whole, maybe a decent starter book for someone trying to understand American Evangelicalism, but definitely feels like an amalgamation of high-level content rather than a primary source.
