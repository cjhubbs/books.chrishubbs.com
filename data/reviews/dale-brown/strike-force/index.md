I enjoy Brown’s novels for being a bit forward-looking, and yeah, for the sweet technology. However, his plots are getting tired; every book for the last several has been the general with all the cool toys saving the world whilst facing opposition from a political and military establishment that distrusts him. It worked the first few times, but now, it’s getting a bit threadbare.
