Take one part NT Wright's work on the Kingdom of God, one part Richard Beck's thoughts on scapegoats, add in a few questionable interpretations of some of Jesus' parables, avoid questions about how the personal view interacts with the political view/necessity of violence, and you have this book. Well intentioned but ultimately lacking.
