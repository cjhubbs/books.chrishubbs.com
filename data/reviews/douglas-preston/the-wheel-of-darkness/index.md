This Agent Pendergast series by Preston/Child is another one I really enjoy. This one was far more into the spiritist/Buddhism angle than previous books have been, but it still wound into the story OK. It was enjoyable to have Constance Greene (Agent Pendergast’s “ward”) play a larger role in this story, too.
