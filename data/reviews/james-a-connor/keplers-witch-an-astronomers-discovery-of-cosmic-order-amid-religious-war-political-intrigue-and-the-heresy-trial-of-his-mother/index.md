This biography of Johannes Kepler chronicles how his faith interacted with his scientific discoveries, and the persecution he went through as a Lutheran in a land dominated by Catholics. A well-written book, respectful of Kepler’s faith, and drawn from new, first-time translations of several of Kepler’s letters. Interesting stuff.
