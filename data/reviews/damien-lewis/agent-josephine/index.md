This book tried to be too long with too little source material. The author (a British journalist) was working from 3 short books written by primary characters in the story, and with so little material he leaves us with nothing about Baker's life before or after the war, and gives us large swaths of WWII history that have little to do with Baker.

I get the sense from the book that Josephine Baker was a remarkable woman, and I'd like to read a better biography of her.
