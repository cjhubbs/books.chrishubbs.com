A very readable overview of how early Christian fathers read the OT scriptures, specifically around anthropomorphic descriptions of God, and passages that describe God in troubling ways. Heartening to see that their consensus was that the truest picture we have of God is in the teaching of Jesus, and then that they used all sorts of rationalization and vibes to figure out what to do with the Old Testament.
