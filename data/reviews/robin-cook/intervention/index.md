Usually Robin Cook is a safe bet for a solid mystery.  Which leaves me bewildered as to what happened in this book. It's as if he took two parts Dan Brown, one part anti-homeopathic medicine, and a large dose of horrible dialogue, and threw them all in a blender. <br/><br/>Characters don't make sense, inexplicable plot twists, unsatisfying resolutions...  ick ick ick. <br/><br/>NOT recommended.
