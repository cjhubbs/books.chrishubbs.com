A short, concise, very readable argument that Jesus held to the importance of Jewish purity law, but that He introduced to the world a power of purity so strong that it overwhelmed the forces of death and impurity around Him. Really fascinating stuff. (If I never have to read the phrase 'genital discharge' again, though, it'll still be too soon.)
