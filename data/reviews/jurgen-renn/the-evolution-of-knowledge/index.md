A thick book, Dr. Renn spends most of the time overviewing how human knowledge has accumulated over time. He spends frustratingly little time theorizing how those insights might lead us to think about the future. The "future" part is only about 15 pages at the end. I'm glad I read it just to stretch my brain, but I didn't come away from it with any deep thoughts about the future.
