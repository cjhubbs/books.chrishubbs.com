This guy is cranking out stories at a pace that seems to mean each one is a little bit poorer than the one before. Oklahoma lawyer Ben Kincaid, having made his way up from little-guy lawyer to US senator, now finds himself at the heart of a Homeland Security plot to assassinate the First Lady, force through a Constitutional amendment to allow the suspension of the Bill of Rights, and, well, you get the idea. Entertaining, but vapid.
