A sci-fi novel originally mapped out by Heinlein, then completed by Robinson after Heinlein’s death. The lead character, after finding out the girl he loves is the heir to the galaxy’s largest fortune, takes off on an “intergalactic bender”… hey, it’s a good story. Probably my favorite of the year thus far.
