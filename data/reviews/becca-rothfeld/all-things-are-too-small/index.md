An uninspiring little book of essays. Rothfeld really dislikes the practice of mindfulness and really, *really* likes sex. To those observations I would only add that her reasoning is often sketchy and her arguments tepid. I was hoping to have my imagination inflamed but only got tired of her endless chapters about sex.
