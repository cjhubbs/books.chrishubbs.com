In just a short book, Dan Brennan makes a strong case for throwing out almost everything you've learned from the evangelical church about cross-gender friendships outside of marriage.  While at times it felt like he was trying to stretch his material enough to make it book-length, his argument resonates with me.  It's worth considering how much more our own lives (and the church!) would flourish if these friendships were encouraged rather than dismissed.
