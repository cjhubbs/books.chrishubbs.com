I wanted to *love* this book. Jeffrey's ideas and balance of science and tech with a good story is right in my wheelhouse. He's just not a strong enough writer to take it from being good to being _amazing_. To much telling, not enough showing. Too much omniscient narrator waxing eloquent. Still a good book, and I immediately took up the sequel.
