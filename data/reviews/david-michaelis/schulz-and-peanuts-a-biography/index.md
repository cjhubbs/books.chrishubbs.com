A very good but ultimately very sad biography of Charles M. Schulz, whose life seemed to bear out the aphorism that great art comes from troubled psyches. I didn’t realize how much _Peanuts_ represented Schulz’s life… interesting. Sad that a man who had so much to contribute spent his whole life feeling like no one loved him.
