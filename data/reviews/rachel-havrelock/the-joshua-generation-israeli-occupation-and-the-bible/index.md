An interesting and yet odd little book. <br/><br/>Basic structure:<br/>- Ch. 1 & 2: Overview of the Book of Joshua<br/>- Ch. 3 & 4: How David Ben-Gurion led modern Israel to read Joshua in a way that cast Jewish settlers as the re-embodiment of Joshua and the Israelites, driving out the Canaanites. <br/>- Conclusion: Excursus on the struggle between the Israelis and Palestinians for Palestinian access to fresh water, with two sentences at the end dreaming about a future where they give up the strife. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the book, especially chapters 3&4. I am fascinated by the idea that modern Israelis have used novel interpretations of the Bible to support their political cause in ways that seem very familiar to American evangelicals. <br/><br/>The conclusion seemed like a complete non sequitur, a tacked-on ending apparently important to the author but almost completely unrelated to the bulk of the book. Iâ€™m very surprised the editor allowed her to keep it. <br/><br/>Still worth a read for the main body of the book.
