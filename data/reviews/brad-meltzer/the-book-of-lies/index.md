At one point I like Meltzer...  but this one: ugh.<br/><br/>Just when you think the DaVinci knock-offs have gone as far as they can go in the spectrum of ridiculousness, then comes Book of Lies, which tries to tie together mysteries surrounding Cain (from the Bible), a mysterious secretive group of Aryans, and...  wait for it... the creator of the Superman comic.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and avoid.
