I was taking a chance on this one; I have gotten sick of the _Davinci_-esque novels, but I have enjoyed Meltzer in the past. I wasn’t disappointed here; the whole thing with the Freemasons seems to have been hacked in just so the publisher could try to sell it as being in the _Davinci_ genre; in reality, it’s just a solid thriller/whodunit. An entertaining read.
