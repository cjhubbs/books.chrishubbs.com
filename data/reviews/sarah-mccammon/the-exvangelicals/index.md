McCammon has written the book that tells the Exvangelical story as clearly and simply as anyone will. Her story is largely my own story; the differences are incidental, the similarities huge. If there's anyone looking for an understanding of why the exvangelical movement has been a thing over the past decade. this is the book to put in their hands. I appreciate both McCammon's directness and her gentle humility. Good stuff.
