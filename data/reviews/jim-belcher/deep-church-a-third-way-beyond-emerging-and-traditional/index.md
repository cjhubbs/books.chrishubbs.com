Not as revolutionary or insightful as I had hoped, but still good.  Belcher identifies seven areas of contention between the emerging and traditional churches, summarizes each group's position on each topic, and then identifies his "third way" for each of them.<br/><br/>Most of his "third ways" seemed less like brilliant insights and more like "let's pick someplace in between the two positions that makes sense to me".  <br/><br/><i>Deep Church</i> is a good summary of emerging vs. traditional if you're unfamiliar with the topic, is very even-handed, etc.  But at least to this guy, who has watched most of the emerging vs. traditional battle play out in books and on the blogs over the past several years, there wasn't a lot new here.
