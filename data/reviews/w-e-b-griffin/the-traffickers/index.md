Yeah, so I'm a sucker for WEB Griffin, and especially his Investigators series.  Now, just because I give this 4 stars and Pride & Prejudice only 3 doesn't mean that I think this is objectively a better piece of literature - far from it.  Nothing profound or brilliant. However, I found this quite entertaining - a fun read.
