I have long been a fan of Griffinâ€™s various wartime series; they are some seriously good writing and characters. This one was a weaker effort; it felt less like a story in its own right and more like a bunch of narrative and character development that needed to happen to connect the previous book to the presumably-upcoming book. Ah well, still enjoyable.
