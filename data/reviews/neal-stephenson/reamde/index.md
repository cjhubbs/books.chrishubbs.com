If you're willing to invest in a book this long, Stephenson at least keeps it engaging.  Some other reviewer described it as a "data dump", and boy was he right. The combination of data dump, backstories, and the weaving of a bunch of story lines together is an impressive feat.  The best I can liken it to is if Tom Clancy were writing novels about international terrorists and MMORPGs instead of Cold War non-nuclear battle scenarios, you'd get something like /Reamde/.<br/><br/>An entertaining read, but it requires a commitment.
