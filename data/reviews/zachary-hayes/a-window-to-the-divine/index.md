A short but dense treatise proposing a way harmonize Christian perspective on creation with a modern understanding of science. Draws on Teilhard and Whitehead, and while the middle chapters suffer from the author's need to deal with some Roman Catholic nuances, the opening and closing chapters are fully worth the weight of the book.
