I was pretty excited to get my hands on this one. I have very much enjoyed Keller’s teaching, especially as it relates to urban ministry and reaching postmoderns with the gospel. Maybe I was expecting too much from this book, but it left me unimpressed. I wanted something new, insightful; Keller rehashed the stuff we’ve all read already, quoting extensively from C. S. Lewis, Alvin Plantinga, and a few others. This might be a good book to give to your thinking friend who is wrestling with the ideas of Christianity, but for me, it was only OK.
