Ilia Delio's most comprehensive statement yet of her synthesis of Teilhard and Jung. We need a framework for thinking about God that embraces what we know today about quantum physics and evolution. I'm not entirely convinced by her enthusiasm for tech-based transhumanism, but the integration of all things seems very right to me.
