# books.chrishubbs.com

This project is a static site generator for [books.chrishubbs.com](https://books.chrishubbs.com). The core of this functionality is heavily based on [Rixx's books site](https://github.com/rixx/books.rixx.de). This version is updated to import book data from a Goodreads export file. (Rixx leaned on the Goodreads developer API, but Amazon is no longer providing developer keys for it.)
