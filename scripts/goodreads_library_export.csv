Lenz's own story illustrates how divisive these issues can be on a personal level. She doesn't pull punches as she recounts the end of her marriage, leaving one church, having a church plant die, and her struggles to find supportive community.<br/><br/>God Land's clear affection for Middle America and portraits of small-town Americans combined with Lenz' beautiful prose and painfully honest diagnosis make it a must-read in 2019 America.",,,1,0

John Clark and Ding Chavez play primary roles in Locked On, and it's hard to do anything but root for them.  However, Clancy's writing has gone significantly downhill, and this book is just the latest example of that slide.<br/><br/>Clancy lovers have come to expect long, thick novels, and picking this one up off the shelf leads you to believe that it is another of similar size to classics like Red Storm Rising or Clear and Present Danger.  However, opening the 900-page book you find that the publisher has reverted to tricks a lazy student uses with a college paper - wide margins, large line spacing, big fonts.  There is probably only 60% of the content that used to be in a 900-page Clancy novel.<br/><br/>The book is also sloppily edited. For example, at one point it is noted that Chavez and Clark have been partners ""for over 20 years"".  Further on, though, Chavez says that Clark ""is more than twice my age - what, 63, 64?""  It doesn't take a math whiz to figure out those numbers are screwed up. <br/><br/>Back in the glory days of this genre, Clancy was cranking out great stuff, WEB Griffin was top-notch, and Larry Bond was putting out some good stuff in the genre when he wasn't co-writing with Clancy. Today, though, I haven't found a younger author to fill that void; everybody seems to be focused on writing 300-page quickies rather than Clancy-length epics. Sad.",,,1,0

I had previously read his book Vertical Self and enjoyed it quite a bit, so I was looking forward to his newest offering.<br/><br/>The Road Trip that Changed the World draws its title and chief topic from the classic American novel On The Road by Jack Kerouac. Sayers examines how Kerouac’s novel incited a generation to leave the ideals of home, family, and place and instead to chase the dream of the road, the hope of whatever lays just beyond the horizon.<br/><br/>He spends a good chapter discussing our search for the transcendent, and notes how when we fail to notice and embrace the transcendence in the material here and now, we end up constantly looking for the next “woosh” – a fleeting moment of awe that makes us feel alive but quickly leaves us searching for the next hit.<br/><br/>The first two-thirds of the book is devoted to this examination of the shift in American culture brought on by Kerouac; the last third brings things around to the gospel. Sayers discusses Abraham as “the first counter-cultural rebel”, and traces a path through the Old and New Testaments, ultimately concluding that we need to reject the endless search for the “woosh” over the horizon, instead finding joy and meaning and transcendence in the here and now, as we experience true community and relationship with God.<br/><br/>I’ll say this – Sayers has the spirit of the times nailed. If anything, I didn’t respond to it more because it already seemed so familiar. His diagnosis of cynicism, distance, and the search for transcendence in “woosh” moments is right on. His prescription of embracing community and finding transcendence in experiencing God is a call appropriate for the time. If my cynical generation is willing to hear it, The Road Trip that Changed the World is a great call back to what really matters.<br/><br/>Note: I was provided a free copy of the book in return for reading and posting a fair review.",,,1,0

Ryan actually plays only a minor part in this book, with the primary narrative focus being on John Clark, Ding Chavez, and Jack Ryan, Jr.  The threat abroad is still nukes and wacko Muslims, and the threat at home is still politicians who don't understand the value of a strong CIA and strong military.  So yeah, it's basically the same note Clancy has been playing for years now.<br/><br/>The book runs to 950 pages, but the margins and line spacing are larger than his older novels, so it's not quite the same length as, say, <i>The Sum of All Fears</i>. Multiple characters are introduced and woven together in classic Clancy style, and the book would probably work better as a stand-alone novel than as a follow-up to a classic series.  <br/><br/>As a sidenote, the proofreading was apparently sloppy; I caught four typos in my quick read of the book. <br/><br/>Not a bad read; better than most of what is out in this genre today, but not up to the level you'd expect from classic Clancy.",true,,1,0
